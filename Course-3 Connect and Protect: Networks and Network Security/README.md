# Connect and Protect: Networks and Network Security

In this course, I have successfully completed advanced training in **Network security**, focusing on its critical role in addressing ongoing security threats and vulnerabilities. This training encompassed a detailed understanding of **network architecture** and the mechanisms employed to secure networks, including the analysis of **network protocols** and the vulnerabilities they may introduce during communication.

Key areas of expertise include the implementation of **firewalls** and other security measures to ensure reliable and secure network operations. I gained insights into various types of **network attacks** and effective techniques to secure compromised systems and devices. This involved examining how malicious actors exploit vulnerabilities in network infrastructure and applying strategies to identify and mitigate potential security risks.

Moreover, I developed proficiency in **network hardening practices**, which strengthen systems against intrusion methods and evolving threats. My training also emphasized addressing the unique security challenges associated with **cloud infrastructures**, leveraging advanced hardening techniques to enhance the overall resilience and integrity of network systems.
