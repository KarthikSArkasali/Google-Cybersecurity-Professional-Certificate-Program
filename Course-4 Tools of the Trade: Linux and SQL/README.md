#  Tools of the Trade: Linux and SQL

In this Course, I have completed comprehensive training in **Operating systems** and **database management**, gaining a deep understanding of the relationship between **operating systems**, **hardware**, and **software**, as well as the primary functions of an operating system. I explored widely used operating systems, including their interfaces, understanding how both **Graphical user interfaces (GUIs)** and **Command-line interfaces (CLIs)** enable user interaction with the system.

My training included an introduction to the **Linux operating system**, focusing on its critical role in cybersecurity. I gained knowledge of **Linux architecture**, common distributions, and the Linux shell, which facilitates communication with the operating system. This included practical experience using **Linux commands** through the **Bash shell** to navigate and manage the file system, as well as to handle user authorization and authentication processes. I also developed strategies for troubleshooting and learning new Linux commands effectively.

Additionally, I acquired hands-on experience with **SQL**, using it to communicate with databases. This included querying databases, filtering results, and joining multiple tables in a query to extract meaningful insights. This training has equipped me with the skills to manage and interact with both operating systems and databases efficiently, further enhancing my technical proficiency.

# Portfolio Activity: Use Linux commands to manage file permissions

**Activity Overview**

In this activity, you will create a new portfolio document to demonstrate your experience using Linux commands to manage file permissions. You can add this document to your cybersecurity portfolio, which you can share with prospective employers or recruiters. To review the importance of building a professional portfolio and options for creating your portfolio, read 
Create a cybersecurity portfolio

To create your portfolio document, you will review a scenario and follow a series of steps. This scenario is connected to the lab you have just completed about how to examine and manage file permissions. You will explain the commands you used in that lab, and this will help you prepare for future job interviews and other steps in the hiring process.

**Scenario**

Review the scenario below. Then, complete the step-by-step instructions.

You are a security professional at a large organization. You mainly work with their research team. Part of your job is to ensure users on this team are authorized with the appropriate permissions. This helps keep the system secure. 

Your task is to examine existing permissions on the file system. You’ll need to determine if the permissions match the authorization that should be given. If they do not match, you’ll need to modify the permissions to authorize the appropriate users and remove any unauthorized access.

**Step 1: Access the template**
To use the template for this course item, click the following link and select Use Template. (In this step, you will just open the template. More instructions for how to use the template will be included in later steps.)

**Step 2: Access Supporting Document**
The following supporting materials will help you complete this activity. Keep them open as you proceed to the next steps.

The Instructions for including Linux commands document provides instructions and best practices for including samples of Linux commands in your portfolio activity.<br>
The **Current file permissions** document demonstrates how the file structure is built for this portfolio activity. The file permissions for each file or directory are also provided.

**Step 3: Check File & Directory details**

In the **Manage authorization** lab, check the permissions set for files and subdirectories in the **projects directory**. Make sure you display all permissions, including hidden files. Or, use the content of **Current file permissions** document to determine the current permissions. 

Describe the command you can use to check permissions in the **Check file and directory details** section of the **File permissions in Linux** template. From the lab, take a screenshot of the Linux command you used. Or, type this command directly into the template.

Then, use either the output of this command in the lab or the content or the **Current file permissions** document to indicate the current permissions. If using the **Current file permissions** document, write these in the 10-character string that would be part of the command's output.

**Step 4: Describe the permissions string**

Choose one example from the output in the previous step. In the Describe the permissions string section of the File permissions in Linux template, write a short description that explains the 10-character string in the example. You should describe what the 10-character string is for and what each character represents.

**Step 5: Change file permission**

The organization does not allow other to have write access to any files. Based on the permissions established in Step 3, identify which file needs to have its permissions modified. Use a Linux command to modify these permissions.

Describe the command you used and its output in the Change file permissions section of the File permissions in Linux template. In the Manage authorization lab, take a screenshot of the Linux command you used. Or, type this command directly into the template.

**Step 6: Change the file permission on hidden file**

The research team has archived .project_x.txt, which is why it’s a hidden file. This file should not have write permissions for anyone, but the user and group should be able to read the file. Use a Linux command to assign .project_x.txt the appropriate authorization.

Describe the command you used and its output in the Change file permissions on a hidden file section of the File permissions in Linux template. In the Manage authorization lab, take a screenshot of the Linux command you used. Or, type this command directly into the template.

**Step 7: Change directory permissions**

The files and directories in the projects directory belong to the researcher2 user. Only researcher2 should be allowed to access the drafts directory and its contents. Use a Linux command to modify the permissions accordingly.

Describe the command you used and its output in the Change directory permissions section of the File permissions in Linux template. In the Manage authorization lab, take a screenshot of the Linux command you used. Or, type this command directly into the template.

**Step 8: Finalize your Document**

To finalize the document and make its purpose clear to potential employers, be sure to complete the Project description and Summary sections of the File permissions in Linux template. 

In the Project description section, give a general overview of the scenario and what you accomplish through Linux. Write two to four sentences.

In the Summary section, provide a short summary of the previous tasks and connect them to the scenario. Write approximately two to four sentences.
