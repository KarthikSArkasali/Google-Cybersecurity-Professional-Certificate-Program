#  Tools of the Trade: Linux and SQL

In this Course, I have completed comprehensive training in **Operating systems** and **database management**, gaining a deep understanding of the relationship between **operating systems**, **hardware**, and **software**, as well as the primary functions of an operating system. I explored widely used operating systems, including their interfaces, understanding how both **Graphical user interfaces (GUIs)** and **Command-line interfaces (CLIs)** enable user interaction with the system.

My training included an introduction to the **Linux operating system**, focusing on its critical role in cybersecurity. I gained knowledge of **Linux architecture**, common distributions, and the Linux shell, which facilitates communication with the operating system. This included practical experience using **Linux commands** through the **Bash shell** to navigate and manage the file system, as well as to handle user authorization and authentication processes. I also developed strategies for troubleshooting and learning new Linux commands effectively.

Additionally, I acquired hands-on experience with **SQL**, using it to communicate with databases. This included querying databases, filtering results, and joining multiple tables in a query to extract meaningful insights. This training has equipped me with the skills to manage and interact with both operating systems and databases efficiently, further enhancing my technical proficiency.
