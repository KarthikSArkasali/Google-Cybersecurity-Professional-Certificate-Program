#  Tools of the Trade: Linux and SQL

In this Course, I have completed comprehensive training in **Operating systems** and **database management**, gaining a deep understanding of the relationship between **operating systems**, **hardware**, and **software**, as well as the primary functions of an operating system. I explored widely used operating systems, including their interfaces, understanding how both **Graphical user interfaces (GUIs)** and **Command-line interfaces (CLIs)** enable user interaction with the system.

My training included an introduction to the **Linux operating system**, focusing on its critical role in cybersecurity. I gained knowledge of **Linux architecture**, common distributions, and the Linux shell, which facilitates communication with the operating system. This included practical experience using **Linux commands** through the **Bash shell** to navigate and manage the file system, as well as to handle user authorization and authentication processes. I also developed strategies for troubleshooting and learning new Linux commands effectively.

Additionally, I acquired hands-on experience with **SQL**, using it to communicate with databases. This included querying databases, filtering results, and joining multiple tables in a query to extract meaningful insights. This training has equipped me with the skills to manage and interact with both operating systems and databases efficiently, further enhancing my technical proficiency.

# Portfolio Activity #1: Use Linux commands to manage file permissions

**Activity Overview**

In this activity, you will create a new portfolio document to demonstrate your experience using Linux commands to manage file permissions. You can add this document to your cybersecurity portfolio, which you can share with prospective employers or recruiters. To review the importance of building a professional portfolio and options for creating your portfolio, read 
Create a cybersecurity portfolio

To create your portfolio document, you will review a scenario and follow a series of steps. This scenario is connected to the lab you have just completed about how to examine and manage file permissions. You will explain the commands you used in that lab, and this will help you prepare for future job interviews and other steps in the hiring process.

**Scenario**

Review the scenario below. Then, complete the step-by-step instructions.

You are a security professional at a large organization. You mainly work with their research team. Part of your job is to ensure users on this team are authorized with the appropriate permissions. This helps keep the system secure. 

Your task is to examine existing permissions on the file system. You’ll need to determine if the permissions match the authorization that should be given. If they do not match, you’ll need to modify the permissions to authorize the appropriate users and remove any unauthorized access.

# Portfolio Activity #2: Apply filters to SQL queries

**Activity Overview**

In this activity, you will create a new portfolio document to demonstrate your experience using SQL. You can add this document to your cybersecurity portfolio, which you can share with prospective employers or recruiters. To review the importance of building a professional portfolio and options for creating your portfolio, read Create a cybersecurity portfolio

To create your portfolio document, you will review a scenario and follow a series of steps. This scenario is connected to the lab you have just completed about using the AND, OR, and NOT operators in SQL to filter for information. You will explain the queries you performed in that lab, and this will help you prepare for future job interviews and other steps in the hiring process.

**Scenario**

Review the scenario below. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

You are a security professional at a large organization. Part of your job is to investigate security issues to help keep the system secure. You recently discovered some potential security issues that involve login attempts and employee machines.

Your task is to examine the organization’s data in their employees and log_in_attempts tables. You’ll need to use SQL filters to retrieve records from different datasets and investigate the potential security issues.
