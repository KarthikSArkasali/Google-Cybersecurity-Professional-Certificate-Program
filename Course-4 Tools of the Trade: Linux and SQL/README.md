#  Tools of the Trade: Linux and SQL

In this Course, I have completed comprehensive training in **Operating systems** and **database management**, gaining a deep understanding of the relationship between **operating systems**, **hardware**, and **software**, as well as the primary functions of an operating system. I explored widely used operating systems, including their interfaces, understanding how both **Graphical user interfaces (GUIs)** and **Command-line interfaces (CLIs)** enable user interaction with the system.

My training included an introduction to the **Linux operating system**, focusing on its critical role in cybersecurity. I gained knowledge of **Linux architecture**, common distributions, and the Linux shell, which facilitates communication with the operating system. This included practical experience using **Linux commands** through the **Bash shell** to navigate and manage the file system, as well as to handle user authorization and authentication processes. I also developed strategies for troubleshooting and learning new Linux commands effectively.

Additionally, I acquired hands-on experience with **SQL**, using it to communicate with databases. This included querying databases, filtering results, and joining multiple tables in a query to extract meaningful insights. This training has equipped me with the skills to manage and interact with both operating systems and databases efficiently, further enhancing my technical proficiency.

Create a cybersecurity portfolio

To create your portfolio document, you will review a scenario and follow a series of steps. This scenario is connected to the lab you have just completed about how to examine and manage file permissions. You will explain the commands you used in that lab, and this will help you prepare for future job interviews and other steps in the hiring process.

**Scenario**

Review the scenario below. Then, complete the step-by-step instructions.

You are a security professional at a large organization. You mainly work with their research team. Part of your job is to ensure users on this team are authorized with the appropriate permissions. This helps keep the system secure. 

Your task is to examine existing permissions on the file system. You’ll need to determine if the permissions match the authorization that should be given. If they do not match, you’ll need to modify the permissions to authorize the appropriate users and remove any unauthorized access.

**Step-By-Step Instructions**

**Step 1: Access the template**

Link to template: [Portfolio (Part-1) Current file permissions.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17929567/Portfolio.Part-1.Current.file.permissions.pdf)

**Step 3: Check File & Directory details**

In the **Manage authorization** lab, check the permissions set for files and subdirectories in the **projects directory**. Make sure you display all permissions, including hidden files. Or, use the content of **Current file permissions** document to determine the current permissions. 

Describe the command you can use to check permissions in the **Check file and directory details** section of the **File permissions in Linux** template. From the lab, take a screenshot of the Linux command you used. Or, type this command directly into the template.

Then, use either the output of this command in the lab or the content or the **Current file permissions** document to indicate the current permissions. If using the **Current file permissions** document, write these in the 10-character string that would be part of the command's output.

**Step 4: Describe the permissions string**

Choose one example from the output in the previous step. In the **Describe the permissions string** section of the **File permissions in Linux** template, write a short description that explains the 10-character string in the example. You should describe what the 10-character string is for and what each character represents.

**Step 5: Change file permission**

The organization does not allow other to have write access to any files. Based on the permissions established in Step 3, identify which file needs to have its permissions modified. Use a Linux command to modify these permissions.

Describe the command you used and its output in the **Change file permissions** section of the **File permissions in Linux** template. In the **Manage authorization** lab, take a screenshot of the Linux command you used. Or, type this command directly into the template.

**Step 6: Change the file permission on hidden file**

The research team has archived **.project_x.txt**, which is why it’s a hidden file. This file should not have write permissions for anyone, but the user and group should be able to read the file. Use a Linux command to assign **.project_x.txt** the appropriate authorization.

Describe the command you used and its output in the **Change file permissions on a hidden file** section of the **File permissions in Linux template**. In the **Manage authorization** lab, take a screenshot of the Linux command you used. Or, type this command directly into the template.

**Step 7: Change directory permissions**

The files and directories in the projects directory belong to the **researcher2** user. Only **researcher2** should be allowed to access the **drafts** directory and its contents. Use a Linux command to modify the permissions accordingly.

Describe the command you used and its output in the **Change directory permissions** section of the **File permissions in Linux** template. In the **Manage authorization** lab, take a screenshot of the Linux command you used. Or, type this command directly into the template.

**Step 8: Finalize your Document**

To finalize the document and make its purpose clear to potential employers, be sure to complete the **Project description** and **Summary** sections of the **File permissions** in Linux template. 

In the Project description section, give a general overview of the scenario and what you accomplish through Linux. Write two to four sentences.

In the Summary section, provide a short summary of the previous tasks and connect them to the scenario. Write approximately two to four sentences.

# Portfolio Activity #2: Apply filters to SQL queries

**Activity Overview**

In this activity, you will create a new portfolio document to demonstrate your experience using SQL. You can add this document to your cybersecurity portfolio, which you can share with prospective employers or recruiters. To review the importance of building a professional portfolio and options for creating your portfolio, read Create a cybersecurity portfolio

To create your portfolio document, you will review a scenario and follow a series of steps. This scenario is connected to the lab you have just completed about using the AND, OR, and NOT operators in SQL to filter for information. You will explain the queries you performed in that lab, and this will help you prepare for future job interviews and other steps in the hiring process.

**Scenario**

Review the scenario below. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

You are a security professional at a large organization. Part of your job is to investigate security issues to help keep the system secure. You recently discovered some potential security issues that involve login attempts and employee machines.

Your task is to examine the organization’s data in their employees and log_in_attempts tables. You’ll need to use SQL filters to retrieve records from different datasets and investigate the potential security issues.

**Step 3: Retrieve after hours failed login attempts**

You recently discovered a potential security incident that occurred after business hours. To investigate this, you need to query the **log_in_attempts** table and review after hours login activity. Use filters in SQL to create a query that identifies all failed login attempts that occurred after 18:00. (The time of the login attempt is found in the **login_time** column. The **success** column contains a value of 0 when a login attempt failed; you can use either a value of 0 or **FALSE** in your query to identify failed login attempts.)

Describe your query and how it works in the **Retrieve after hours failed login attempts** section of the **Apply filters to SQL queries** template. 

In the **Filter with AND, OR, and NOT** lab, take a screenshot of the SQL query you used and copy it into the template. Or, type this query directly into the template.

**Step 4: Retrieve login attempts on specific dates**

A suspicious event occurred on 2022-05-09. To investigate this event, you want to review all login attempts which occurred on this day and the day before. Use filters in SQL to create a query that identifies all login attempts that occurred on 2022-05-09 or 2022-05-08. (The date of the login attempt is found in the **login_date** column.)

Describe your query and how it works in the **Retrieve login attempts on specific dates** section of the **Apply filters to SQL queries** template. 

In the **Filter with AND, OR, and NOT** lab, take a screenshot of the SQL query you used and copy it into the template. Or, type this query directly into the template.

**Step 5: Retrieve login attempts outside of mexico**

There’s been suspicious activity with login attempts, but the team has determined that this activity didn't originate in Mexico. Now, you need to investigate login attempts that occurred outside of Mexico. Use filters in SQL to create a query that identifies all login attempts that occurred outside of Mexico. (When referring to Mexico, the **country** column contains values of both **MEX** and **MEXICO**, and you need to use the LIKE keyword with % to make sure your query reflects this.)

Describe your query and how it works in the **Retrieve login attempts outside of Mexico** section of the **Apply filters to SQL queries** template. 

In the **Filter with AND, OR, and NOT** lab, take a screenshot of the SQL query you used and copy it into the template. Or, type this query directly into the template.

**Step 6: Retrieve employees in marketing**

Your team wants to perform security updates on specific employee machines in the Marketing department. You’re responsible for getting information on these employee machines and will need to query the **employees** table. Use filters in SQL to create a query that identifies all employees in the Marketing department for all offices in the East building.

(The department of the employee is found in the **department** column, which contains values that include **Marketing**. The office is found in the office column. Some examples of values in this column are **East-170, East-320, and North-434**. You’ll need to use the **LIKE** keyword with % to filter for the East building.)

Describe your query and how it works in the **Retrieve employees in Marketing** section of the **Apply filters to SQL queries** template. 

In the **Filter with AND, OR, and NOT** lab, take a screenshot of the SQL query you used and copy it into the template. Or, type this query directly into the template.

**Step 7: Retrieve employees in Finances & Sales**

Your team now needs to perform a different security update on machines for employees in the Sales and Finance departments. Use filters in SQL to create a query that identifies all employees in the Sales or Finance departments. (The department of the employee is found in the **department** column, which contains values that include **Sales** and **Finance**.)

Describe your query and how it works in the **Retrieve employees in Finance or Sales** section of the **Apply filters to SQL queries** template. 

In the **Filter with AND, OR, and NOT** lab, take a screenshot of the SQL query you used and copy it into the template. Or, type this query directly into the template.

**Step 8: Retrieve all employees not in IT**

Your team needs to make one more update to employee machines. The employees who are in the Information Technology department already had this update, but employees in all other departments need it. Use filters in SQL to create a query which identifies all employees not in the IT department. (The department of the employee is found in the **department** column, which contains values that include **Information Technology**.)

Describe your query and how it works in the **Retrieve all employees not in IT** section of the **Apply filters to SQL queries** template. 

In the **Filter with AND, OR, and NOT** lab, take a screenshot of the SQL query you used and copy it into the template. Or, type this query directly into the template.

**Step 9: Finalize your document**

To finalize the document and make its purpose clear to potential employers, be sure to complete the **Project description** and **Summary** sections of the **Apply filters to SQL queries** template. 

In the Project description section, give a general overview of the scenario and what you accomplish through SQL. Write two to four sentences.

In the Summary section, provide a short summary of the previous tasks and connect them to the scenario. Write approximately two to four sentences.
