#  Automate Cybersecurity Tasks with Python

I have completed comprehensive training in **Python programming**, focusing on its application in **cybersecurity**. I began by learning foundational Python concepts, including data types, variables, conditional statements, and iterative structures, which form the basis for effective coding.

I further expanded my Python skills by exploring both **pre-built** and **user-defined functions**, and gaining an understanding of how modules facilitate access to reusable code. I also learned best practices for making code more readable and maintainable. Additionally, I delved into advanced manipulation of **strings** and **lists**, discovering various methods to work with these data types, and applied this knowledge to write short algorithms.

Incorporating **regular expressions**, I developed the ability to search for patterns within strings, enhancing my ability to handle and process text-based data. The training also emphasized **automating cybersecurity tasks**, particularly focusing on file management. I gained practical experience opening and reading files, parsing and structuring their contents, and using Python to automate processes relevant to cybersecurity operations.

Finally, I focused on **debugging strategies**, equipping myself with the skills to troubleshoot and refine Python code effectively. This training has strengthened my ability to use Python for a wide range of cybersecurity-related tasks and challenges.

# Activity #1: Update a file through a Python algorithm

**Activity Overview**

In this activity, you will create a new portfolio document to demonstrate your experience using Python to develop algorithms that involve opening files and parsing their contents. You can add this document to your cybersecurity portfolio, which you can share with prospective employers or recruiters. To review the importance of building a professional portfolio and options for creating your portfolio, read Create a cybersecurity portfolio.

To create your portfolio document, you will review a scenario and follow a series of steps. This scenario is connected to the 
Create another algorithm lab that you have just completed. You will explain the code you developed in that lab, and this will help you prepare for future job interviews and other steps in the hiring process.

**Scenario**

Review the following scenario. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

You are a security professional working at a health care company. As part of your job, you're required to regularly update a file that identifies the employees who can access restricted content. The contents of the file are based on who is working with personal patient records. Employees are restricted access based on their IP address. There is an allow list for IP addresses permitted to sign into the restricted subnetwork. There's also a remove list that identifies which employees you must remove from this allow list.

Your task is to create an algorithm that uses Python code to check whether the allow list contains any IP addresses identified on the remove list. If so, you should remove those IP addresses from the file containing the allow list.
