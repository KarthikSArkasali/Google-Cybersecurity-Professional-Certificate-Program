#  Sound the Alarm: Detection and Response

In this Course, I have completed in-depth training in **Detection and Incident Response**, a critical area of a cybersecurity analyst's role. This training involved understanding how cybersecurity professionals verify and respond to **malicious threats**, with a focus on the steps involved in the **incident response process**.

I gained hands-on experience with **network analysis tools**, particularly **packet sniffers**, to analyze network traffic for malicious activity. This included crafting **filtering commands** to examine the contents of captured packets. I also explored the various processes involved in incident detection, investigation, analysis, and response, and learned how to analyze suspicious **file hashes** to identify potential threats.

A key aspect of my training was the importance of **documentation and evidence collection** during the detection and response phases. I developed skills in reconstructing an incidentâ€™s timeline by mapping artifacts to approximate the chronology of events. Additionally, I studied the role of **logs** in **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** and **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** systems, gaining insight into how these tools detect and respond to attacks.

I was introduced to several IDS and SIEM products and learned how to write basic **IDS rules** to generate alerts for malicious network traffic. This training equipped me with the skills needed to effectively detect, respond to, and document cybersecurity incidents.
