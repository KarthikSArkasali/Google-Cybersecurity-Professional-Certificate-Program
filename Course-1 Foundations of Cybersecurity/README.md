# Foundations of Cybersecurity
In the **Foundations of Cybersecurity** course, I began my journey into the cybersecurity field by gaining a comprehensive understanding of its core principles and the critical responsibilities of cybersecurity professionals. I examined the evolution of cybersecurity threats, tracing their origins alongside the rise of computing and the internet, and explored how past cyberattacks have influenced the development of current security measures.

I studied the eight core security domains and became familiar with essential security frameworks and controls. This included a deep dive into the CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) and various NIST frameworks. Additionally, the course covered the ethics of security practices, emphasizing the importance of integrity in cybersecurity operations.

The course also introduced me to the key tools used by cybersecurity analysts, including Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools, network protocol analyzers, and programming languages like Python and SQL. This foundational knowledge equips me to address and mitigate modern cybersecurity threats effectively.

# The history of earlier attacks 
Two prominent examples of **early malware attacks** that helped shape the field of cybersecurity are the **Brain virus** and the **Morris worm**. These early threats played a pivotal role in raising awareness about the importance of computer security and the need for protective measures against malicious software.

**Brain virus** 

In **1986**, the **Alvi brothers** created the Brain virus with the intention of tracking illegal copies of medical software. However, the virus unexpectedly spread when it infected pirated software and then transferred to any disk inserted into the computer. As a result, the virus spread globally within months, slowing down productivity and impacting business operations. Although it wasn’t designed to destroy data, the Brain virus highlighted the importance of cybersecurity strategies to maintain productivity and security.  

As a **security professional**, preparing for attacks like the Brain virus involves **regular software updates**, **antivirus protection**, and **strict policies against pirated software**. Implementing real-time network monitoring, strong backup systems, and employee training on cybersecurity best practices are essential to detect, contain, and prevent malware spread.

**Morris worm**

In **1988**, **Robert Morris** created a program **Morris worm** to assess the size of the internet, but it unintentionally caused widespread disruption by repeatedly reinstalling itself on infected computers, leading to crashes and affecting 10% of the internet at the time. The Morris worm caused millions in damages and highlighted the need for response teams, leading to the creation of Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs®), which still play a key role in cybersecurity today. This early attack helped shape the security industry, and through my learning, I’ve gained insight into CERT functions and hands-on experience with detection and response tools.

As a **security professional**, preparation involves **patching vulnerabilities**, **using intrusion detection systems (IDS)**, and **having an incident response plan** in place. Regular audits and employee training are key to proactively addressing potential threats.

# The history of digital attacks
To understand the evolution of cyberattacks in the digital age, we’ll look at two major incidents that used the internet: the LoveLetter malware attack and the Equifax data breach. These attacks show how cyber threats have become more sophisticated and how internet-connected systems are increasingly exploited on a large scale. 

**LoveLetter malware** 

In **2000**, **Onel De Guzman** created the LoveLetter malware, which spread rapidly by exploiting human trust. The email, titled "I Love You," contained an attachment that, when opened, scanned the user's address book, sent the malware to all contacts, and collected sensitive information like passwords. This attack affected **45 million** computers and caused over **$10 billion** in damages. It marked the first major example of social engineering—manipulating people into disclosing private information.

After the LoveLetter attack, attackers increasingly used social engineering tactics, especially with the rise of social media and public access to personal data. The growing reliance on convenience over privacy has led to more vulnerabilities if not properly managed. As a **security professional**, it is essential to identify and mitigate risks, including **conducting regular training to help employees** recognize **phishing** and other **social engineering attacks**. These trainings are crucial for safeguarding organizations and individuals against evolving threats. 

**Equifax breach**


The content you've written is mostly aligned, but it can be enhanced for clarity and to ensure a smooth flow. Here’s a refined version:

In **2017**, the Equifax breach exposed the personal information of over **143 million** customers, affecting nearly **40% of Americans**. Attackers gained access to sensitive data, including Social Security numbers, birth dates, and credit card details, by exploiting several unpatched vulnerabilities. Equifax’s failure to address known security flaws led to significant financial and reputational damage. The company was forced to pay over $575 million in fines and settlements, illustrating the severe financial impact of inadequate cybersecurity measures. This breach highlights the critical need for **proactive risk management**, **timely system updates**, and **prioritizing preventative security protocols** to protect sensitive data and maintain trust.

The Equifax breach underscores the importance of implementing strong security practices. As a **security professional**, it's crucial to ensure timely patching of vulnerabilities, robust system monitoring, and conducting regular security audits. Furthermore, applying strong access controls, encrypting sensitive data, and **providing employee training** on **recognizing phishing** and other **social engineering attacks** are essential steps to prevent future breaches and safeguard both organizational and personal data from evolving cyber threats.
