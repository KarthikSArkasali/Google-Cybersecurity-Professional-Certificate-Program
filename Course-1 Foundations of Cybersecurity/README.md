# Foundations of Cybersecurity

I began my journey into cybersecurity by learning about the field and the key responsibilities of cybersecurity professionals. I explored how cybersecurity threats have evolved with the rise of computing and the internet, and how past cyberattacks have shaped the security landscape. I gained an understanding of the eight core security domains, security frameworks, and controls, focusing on the CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) and NIST frameworks. The course also covered security ethics and the tools used by cybersecurity analysts, including SIEM tools, network protocol analyzers, and programming languages like Python and SQL. This foundational knowledge is essential for addressing modern cyber threats.
