#  The history of earlier attacks 
Two prominent examples of **early malware attacks** that helped shape the field of cybersecurity are the **Brain virus** and the **Morris worm**. These early threats played a pivotal role in raising awareness about the importance of computer security and the need for protective measures against malicious software.

**Brain virus** 

In **1986**, the **Alvi brothers** created the Brain virus with the intention of tracking illegal copies of medical software. However, the virus unexpectedly spread when it infected pirated software and then transferred to any disk inserted into the computer. As a result, the virus spread globally within months, slowing down productivity and impacting business operations. Although it wasn’t designed to destroy data, the Brain virus highlighted the importance of cybersecurity strategies to maintain productivity and security.  

As a **security professional**, preparing for attacks like the Brain virus involves **regular software updates**, **antivirus protection**, and **strict policies against pirated software**. Implementing real-time network monitoring, strong backup systems, and employee training on cybersecurity best practices are essential to detect, contain, and prevent malware spread.

**Morris worm**

In **1988**, **Robert Morris** created a program **Morris worm** to assess the size of the internet, but it unintentionally caused widespread disruption by repeatedly reinstalling itself on infected computers, leading to crashes and affecting 10% of the internet at the time. The Morris worm caused millions in damages and highlighted the need for response teams, leading to the creation of Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs®), which still play a key role in cybersecurity today. This early attack helped shape the security industry, and through my learning, I’ve gained insight into CERT functions and hands-on experience with detection and response tools.

As a **security professional**, preparation involves **patching vulnerabilities**, **using intrusion detection systems (IDS)**, and **having an incident response plan** in place. Regular audits and employee training are key to proactively addressing potential threats.

# The history of digital attacks
To understand the evolution of cyberattacks in the digital age, we’ll look at two major incidents that used the internet: the LoveLetter malware attack and the Equifax data breach. These attacks show how cyber threats have become more sophisticated and how internet-connected systems are increasingly exploited on a large scale. 

**LoveLetter malware** 

In **2000**, **Onel De Guzman** created the LoveLetter malware, which spread rapidly by exploiting human trust. The email, titled "I Love You," contained an attachment that, when opened, scanned the user's address book, sent the malware to all contacts, and collected sensitive information like passwords. This attack affected **45 million** computers and caused over **$10 billion** in damages. It marked the first major example of social engineering—manipulating people into disclosing private information.

After the LoveLetter attack, attackers increasingly used social engineering tactics, especially with the rise of social media and public access to personal data. The growing reliance on convenience over privacy has led to more vulnerabilities if not properly managed. As a **security professional**, it is essential to identify and mitigate risks, including **conducting regular training to help employees** recognize **phishing** and other **social engineering attacks**. These trainings are crucial for safeguarding organizations and individuals against evolving threats. 

**Equifax breach**

In **2017**, the Equifax breach exposed the personal information of over **143 million** customers, affecting nearly **40% of Americans**. Attackers gained access to sensitive data, including Social Security numbers, birth dates, and credit card details, by exploiting several unpatched vulnerabilities. Equifax’s failure to address known security flaws led to significant financial and reputational damage. The company was forced to pay over $575 million in fines and settlements, illustrating the severe financial impact of inadequate cybersecurity measures. This breach highlights the critical need for **proactive risk management**, **timely system updates**, and **prioritizing preventative security protocols** to protect sensitive data and maintain trust.

The Equifax breach underscores the importance of implementing strong security practices. As a **security professional**, it's crucial to ensure timely patching of vulnerabilities, robust system monitoring, and conducting regular security audits. Furthermore, applying strong access controls, encrypting sensitive data, and **providing employee training** on **recognizing phishing** and other **social engineering attacks** are essential steps to prevent future breaches and safeguard both organizational and personal data from evolving cyber threats.

#  The Eight Certified Information Systems Security Professional(CISSP) security domains

**Domain 1: Security and Risk Management**.  
Security and risk management focuses on defining security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and the law. For example, security analysts may need to update company policies related to private health information if a change is made to a federal compliance regulation such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, also known as HIPAA.

**Ex**: A healthcare company must comply with HIPAA regulations to protect patient data. If HIPAA updates its privacy rules, the security analyst updates the company’s security policies. This may involve enhancing data encryption, adjusting access controls, and updating the incident response plan to ensure continued compliance and mitigate risks. 

**Domain 2: Asset Security**  
This domain focuses on securing digital and physical assets. It's also related to the storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data. When working with this domain, security analysts may be tasked with making sure that old equipment is properly disposed of and destroyed, including any type of confidential information.

**Ex**: A financial institution needs to securely dispose of old servers with sensitive customer data. The security analyst ensures data is erased using software or physically destroyed, like shredding hard drives, and documents the process to comply with regulations such as GDPR or HIPAA. 

**Domain 3: Security Architecture and Engineering**  
This domain focuses on optimizing data security by ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place. As a security analyst, you may be tasked with configuring a firewall.  A firewall is a device used to monitor and filter incoming and outgoing computer network traffic. Setting up a firewall correctly helps prevent attacks that could affect  productivity. 

**Ex**: A security analyst at a company is tasked with configuring a firewall to protect the network from external threats. The analyst sets up rules to block malicious traffic, allows only necessary communication, and monitors for unusual activity. By properly configuring the firewall, the analyst ensures that the company’s network remains secure, preventing cyberattacks that could disrupt operations. 

**Domain 4: Communication and Network Security**  
This domain focuses on managing and securing physical networks and wireless communications. As a security analyst, you may be asked to analyze user behavior within your organization. 

**Ex**: A security analyst notices unusual user behavior, such as accessing sensitive files after hours. Upon investigation, they find compromised credentials. The analyst quickly isolates the system, resets the password, and reviews network traffic to prevent further breaches, ensuring network security. 

**Domain 5: Identity and Access Management**  
Identity and access management focuses on keeping data secure, by ensuring users follow established policies to control and manage physical assets, like office spaces, and logical assets, such as networks and applications. Validating the identities of employees and documenting access roles are essential to maintaining the organization's physical and digital security. For example, as a security analyst, you may be tasked with setting up employees' keycard access to buildings. 

**Ex**: A security analyst sets up keycard access for new employees, granting entry only to authorized areas based on their role. They also revoke access when employees leave, ensuring physical security. 

**Domain 6: Security Assessment and Testing**  
This domain focuses on conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting security audits to monitor for risks, threats, and vulnerabilities. Security analysts may conduct regular audits of user permissions, to make sure that users have the correct level of access. For example, access to payroll information is often limited to certain employees, so analysts may be asked to regularly audit permissions to ensure that no unauthorized person can view employee salaries. 

**Ex**: A security analyst audits user permissions and finds that a former employee still has access to payroll data. They revoke the access immediately to prevent unauthorized viewing of sensitive information. 

**Domain 7: Security Operations**  
This domain focuses on conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures. Imagine that you, as a security analyst, receive an alert that an unknown device has been connected to your internal network. You would need to follow the organization's policies and procedures to quickly stop the potential threat. 

**Ex**: A security analyst detects an unknown device on the network, isolates it, and investigates to prevent any potential security threats. 

**Domain 8: Software development security**  
This domain focuses on using secure coding practices, which are a set of recommended guidelines that are used to create secure applications and services. A security analyst may work with software development teams to ensure security practices are incorporated into the software development life-cycle. If, for example, one of your partner teams is creating a new mobile app, then you may be asked to advise on the password policies or ensure that any user data is properly secured and managed. 

**Ex**: A security analyst advises a development team on secure coding practices for a new mobile app, ensuring strong password policies and encryption of user data to protect against security threats.

# Controls, frameworks, and compliance
The confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) triad is a model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies. CIA are the three foundational principles used by cybersecurity professionals to establish appropriate controls that mitigate threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.

![CIA](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0096b86a-d7ca-46a2-be54-a6ace0f1d792)

**Security Controls**: are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. So they are used alongside frameworks to ensure that security goals and processes are implemented correctly and that organizations meet regulatory compliance requirements.

**Frameworks**: are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy. They have four core components:

* Identifying and documenting security goals. 
* Setting guidelines to achieve security goals.
* Implementing strong security processes.
* Monitoring and communicating results.
  
**Compliance**: Adhering to regulations like GDPR, PCI DSS, HIPAA, and FedRAMP ensures legal and ethical handling of sensitive information, with a focus on privacy and transparency.Security analysts must stay updated on frameworks and regulations while prioritizing CIA principles to protect organizations and individuals from evolving cyber threats.

* **Center for Internet Security (CIS®)**
  * CIS is a nonprofit with multiple areas of emphasis. It provides a set of controls that can be used to safeguard systems and networks against attacks. Its purpose is to help organizations establish a better plan of defense. CIS also provides actionable controls that security professionals may follow if a security incident occurs.

* **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)**
  * PCI DSS is an international security standard meant to ensure that organizations storing, accepting, processing, and transmitting credit card information do so in a secure environment. The objective of this compliance standard is to reduce credit card fraud.

* **The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**
  * HIPAA is a U.S. federal law established in 1996 to protect patients' health information. This law prohibits patient information from being shared without their consent. It is governed by three rules: 
      * Privacy.
      * Security.
      * Breach notification.<br>
  * Organizations that store patient data have a legal obligation to inform patients of a breach because if patients' Protected Health Information (PHI) is exposed, it can lead to identity theft and insurance 
    fraud. PHI relates to the past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition of an individual, whether it’s a plan of care or payments for care. Along with understanding HIPAA as a law, 
    security professionals also need to be familiar with the Health Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST®), which is a security framework and assurance program that helps institutions meet HIPAA compliance.

* **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**
  * GDPR is a European Union (E.U.) general data regulation that protects the processing of E.U. residents’ data and their right to privacy in and out of E.U. territory. For example, if an organization is not being transparent about the data they are holding about an E.U. citizen and why they are holding that data, this is an infringement that can result in a fine to the organization. Additionally, if a breach occurs and an E.U. citizen’s data is compromised, they must be informed. The affected organization has 72 hours to notify the E.U. citizen about the breach.

* **International Organization for Standardization (ISO)**
  * ISO was created to establish international standards related to technology, manufacturing, and management across borders. It helps organizations improve their processes and procedures for staff retention, planning, waste, and services.
 
# Ethics of Cybersecurity
In cybersecurity, ethics guide professionals in making appropriate decisions, ensuring that access, information, and resources are handled responsibly. Ethical behavior is crucial for protecting sensitive data, maintaining trust, and adhering to legal and organizational standards.

**1. Confidentiality:**
Confidentiality is all about protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access. As a security professional, it's our responsibility to safeguard private data, like Personally Identifiable Information (PII). For example, if I were to grant unauthorized access to a coworker, even if it seemed harmless, it would be highly unethical and could lead to serious consequences, including legal issues and damage to the organization’s reputation.

**2. Privacy Protections:**
Privacy protection means ensuring personal information is used appropriately and not misused. Imagine a situation where a manager requests an employee's private contact details after hours. Sharing that information would breach company policies and ethical standards, even if the request seems urgent. As security professionals, we must always follow the established protocols for handling personal data to ensure privacy is maintained.

**3. Compliance with the Law:**
As cybersecurity professionals, we are bound by laws and regulations that govern data protection. For instance, in a hospital environment, if confidential patient files are left unsecured and unattended, it violates compliance regulations and can result in legal consequences. It's crucial for us to follow these laws carefully to prevent data breaches and ensure that we’re acting ethically and legally at all times.
