# Play It Safe: Manage Security Risks

In the Foundations of Cybersecurity course, I have completed comprehensive training in the CISSP’s eight security domains, gaining a deep understanding of primary threats, risks, and vulnerabilities to business operations. My learning includes expertise in the **National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) Risk Management Framework (RMF)** and the **risk management** process. I am well-versed in security frameworks and controls, with a strong grasp of the core components of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) triad.

Additionally, I have explored the **Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)** security principles and conducted security audits. I have hands-on experience with industry-leading **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** tools, including their use in real-world scenarios by entry-level security analysts to protect business operations. This includes utilizing SIEM dashboards for daily tasks and analyzing security events.

I have also developed proficiency in the purposes and applications of **playbooks**, leveraging them to effectively respond to **identified threats**, **risks**, and **vulnerabilities**, demonstrating my capability in enhancing organizational security posture.

# Threats

A **threat** is any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets. As an entry-level security analyst, your job is to help defend the organization’s assets from inside and outside threats. Therefore, understanding common types of threats is important to an analyst’s daily work. As a reminder, common threats include:

  * **Insider threats:** Staff members or vendors abuse their authorized access to obtain data that may harm an organization.
  * **Advanced persistent threats (APTs):** A threat actor maintains unauthorized access to a system for an extended period of time.

# Risks

A **risk** is anything that can impact the **confidentiality**, **integrity**, or **availability** of an asset. A basic formula for determining the level of risk is that risk equals the likelihood of a threat. One way to think about this is that a risk is being late to work and threats are traffic, an accident, a flat tire, etc. 

There are different factors that can affect the likelihood of a risk to an organization’s assets, including:

 * **External risk:** Anything outside the organization that has the potential to harm organizational assets, such as threat actors attempting to gain access to private information
 * **Internal risk:** A current or former employee, vendor, or trusted partner who poses a security risk
 * **Legacy systems:** Old systems that might not be accounted for or updated, but can still impact assets, such as workstations or old mainframe systems. For example, an organization might have an old vending 
    machine that takes credit card payments or a workstation that is still connected to the legacy accounting system.
 +* **Multiparty risk:** Outsourcing work to third-party vendors can give them access to intellectual property, such as trade secrets, software designs, and inventions.
  * **Software compliance/licensing:** Software that is not updated or in compliance, or patches that are not installed in a timely manner.

# Vulnerabilities

A **vulnerability** is a weakness that can be exploited by a threat. Therefore, organizations need to regularly inspect for vulnerabilities within their systems. Some vulnerabilities include:

 * **ProxyLogon:** A pre-authenticated vulnerability that affects the Microsoft Exchange server. This means a threat actor can complete a user authentication process to deploy malicious code from a remote location.
 * **ZeroLogon:** A vulnerability in Microsoft’s Netlogon authentication protocol. An authentication protocol is a way to verify a person's identity. Netlogon is a service that ensures a user’s identity before allowing access to a website's location.
 * **Log4Shell:** Allows attackers to run Java code on someone else’s computer or leak sensitive information. It does this by enabling a remote attacker to take control of devices connected to the internet and run malicious code.
 * **PetitPotam:** Affects Windows New Technology Local Area Network (LAN) Manager (NTLM). It is a theft technique that allows a LAN-based attacker to initiate an authentication request.
 * **Security logging and monitoring failures:** Insufficient logging and monitoring capabilities that result in attackers exploiting vulnerabilities without the organization knowing it
 * **Server-side request forgery:** Allows attackers to manipulate a server-side application into accessing and updating backend resources. It can also allow threat actors to steal data.

# National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Risk Management Framework (RMF)

The **NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)** is a structured process designed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to help organizations manage and mitigate risks associated with information systems. It provides a comprehensive, flexible, and repeatable approach for integrating security, privacy, and cyber supply chain risk management activities into the system development lifecycle. The RMF aligns with federal standards and supports compliance with laws like the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA).
