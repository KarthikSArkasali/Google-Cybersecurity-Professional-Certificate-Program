# Play It Safe: Manage Security Risks

In the Foundations of Cybersecurity course, I have completed comprehensive training in the CISSP’s eight security domains, gaining a deep understanding of primary threats, risks, and vulnerabilities to business operations. My learning includes expertise in the **National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) Risk Management Framework (RMF)** and the **risk management** process. I am well-versed in security frameworks and controls, with a strong grasp of the core components of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) triad.

Additionally, I have explored the **Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)** security principles and conducted security audits. I have hands-on experience with industry-leading **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** tools, including their use in real-world scenarios by entry-level security analysts to protect business operations. This includes utilizing SIEM dashboards for daily tasks and analyzing security events.

I have also developed proficiency in the purposes and applications of **playbooks**, leveraging them to effectively respond to **identified threats**, **risks**, and **vulnerabilities**, demonstrating my capability in enhancing organizational security posture.

# Portfolio Activity: Conduct a security audit

**Activity Overview**

In part one of this activity, you will conduct an internal security audit, which you can include in your cybersecurity portfolio. To review the importance of building a professional portfolio and options for creating your portfolio, read Create a cybersecurity portfolio.

As a reminder, audits help ensure that security checks are made, to monitor for threats, risks, or vulnerabilities that can affect an organization’s business continuity and critical assets. 

Be sure to complete this activity and answer the questions that follow before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work.  

**Scenario**

Botium Toys is a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys. The business has a single physical location, which serves as their main office, a storefront, and warehouse for their products. However, Botium Toy’s online presence has grown, attracting customers in the U.S. and abroad. As a result, their information technology (IT) department is under increasing pressure to support their online market worldwide. 

The manager of the IT department has decided that an internal IT audit needs to be conducted. She expresses concerns about not having a solidified plan of action to ensure business continuity and compliance, as the business grows. She believes an internal audit can help better secure the company’s infrastructure and help them identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. The manager is also interested in ensuring that they comply with regulations related to internally processing and accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.).   

The IT manager starts by implementing the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), establishing an audit scope and goals, listing assets currently managed by the IT department, and completing a risk assessment. The goal of the audit is to provide an overview of the risks and/or fines that the company might experience due to the current state of their security posture.

Your task is to review the IT manager’s scope, goals, and risk assessment report. Then, perform an internal audit by completing a controls and compliance checklist.

**Part-2**

**Scenario**

Review the following scenario. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

Botium Toys’ IT manager asked you to conduct an internal audit of the company’s assets, controls, and adherence to compliance regulations and standards. Then, based on the company’s current goals and level of risk, she requested that you complete a controls assessment and compliance checklist to identify and explain ways that the company can improve its security posture. 

Your task is to clearly and concisely communicate your findings and recommendations to the IT manager and other stakeholders, so they can implement the necessary controls and create appropriate documentation, processes, and procedures to ensure business continuity, the safety of critical assets, and compliance.
