# Play It Safe: Manage Security Risks

In the Foundations of Cybersecurity course, I have completed comprehensive training in the CISSP’s eight security domains, gaining a deep understanding of primary threats, risks, and vulnerabilities to business operations. My learning includes expertise in the **National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) Risk Management Framework (RMF)** and the **risk management** process. I am well-versed in security frameworks and controls, with a strong grasp of the core components of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) triad.

Additionally, I have explored the **Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)** security principles and conducted security audits. I have hands-on experience with industry-leading **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** tools, including their use in real-world scenarios by entry-level security analysts to protect business operations. This includes utilizing SIEM dashboards for daily tasks and analyzing security events.

I have also developed proficiency in the purposes and applications of playbooks, leveraging them to effectively respond to identified threats, risks, and vulnerabilities, demonstrating my capability in enhancing organizational security posture.
