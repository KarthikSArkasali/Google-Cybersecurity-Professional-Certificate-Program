#  Assets, Threats, and Vulnerabilities

I have completed extensive training on **Asset protection** and **cybersecurity Risk management**, focusing on how organizations determine which assets to protect. This training involved exploring the relationship between **risk management** and **asset classification**, addressing the unique challenges involved in securing both **physical** and **digital assets**. I gained a strong understanding of the **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)** framework, including its standards, guidelines, and best practices for managing cybersecurity risks.

I also developed expertise in **security controls** that safeguard organizational assets, with a particular focus on how **privacy** impacts asset security. I studied the critical role of **encryption** in protecting the privacy of digital assets and the importance of **authentication** and **authorization systems** in verifying users' identities.

Additionally, I acquired a deep understanding of the vulnerability management process, examining common vulnerabilities and adopting an **attacker mindset** to understand how these vulnerabilities can become threats to asset security if exploited. I explored common types of digital asset threats and the tools and techniques used by cybercriminals to target assets. Furthermore, I was introduced to the threat modeling process, learning how security professionals anticipate and mitigate potential security breaches to proactively protect assets.

# Activity #1: Score risks based on their likelihood and severity

**Activity Overview**

In this activity, you will practice performing a risk assessment by evaluating vulnerabilities that commonly threaten business operations. Then, you will decide how to prioritize your resources based on the risk scores you assign each vulnerability.

You might recall that the purpose of having a security plan is to be prepared for risks. Assessing potential risks is one of the first steps of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), a voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk. Risk assessments are how security teams determine whether their security operations are adequately positioned to prevent cyber attacks and protect sensitive information.

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work.

**Scenario**

Review the following scenario. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

You've joined a new cybersecurity team at a commercial bank. The team is conducting a risk assessment of the bank's current operational environment. As part of the assessment, they are creating a risk register to help them focus on securing the most vulnerable risks.

A risk register is a central record of potential risks to an organization's assets, information systems, and data. Security teams commonly use risk registers when conducting a risk assessment.

Your supervisor asks you to evaluate a set of risks that the cybersecurity team has recorded in the risk register. For each risk, you will first determine how likely that risk is to occur. Then, you will determine how severely that risk may impact the bank. Finally, you will calculate a score for the severity of that risk. You will then compare scores across all risks so your team can determine how to prioritize their attention for each risk.

**Step-By-Step Instructions**

Follow the instructions and answer the question below to complete the activity. Then, go to the next course item to compare your work to a completed exemplar.

 * **Step 1: Access the template**
To use the template for this course item, click the following link and select Use Template. 

**Link to template:** [Portfolio (Part-1) Risk register.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17930429/Portfolio.Part-1.Risk.register.pdf)

 * **Step 2: Understand the Operating Environment**

When conducting a risk assessment, it's important to consider the factors that could cause a security event. This often starts with understanding the operating environment.

In this scenario, your team has identified characteristics of the operating environment that could factor into the bank's risk profile:

The bank is located in a coastal area with low crime rates. Many people and systems handle the bank's dataâ€”100 on-premise employees and 20 remote employees. The customer base of the bank includes 2,000 individual accounts and 200 commercial accounts. The bank's services are marketed by a professional sports team and ten local businesses in the community. There are strict financial regulations that require the bank to secure their data and funds, like having enough cash available each day to meet Federal Reserve requirements.

 * **Step 3: Consider potential risks to assets**

Security events are possible when assets are at risk. The source of a risk can range from malicious attackers to accidental human errors. A risk source can even come from natural or environmental hazards, such as a structural failure or power outage.

The bank's funds are one of its key assets. Your team has listed five primary risks to the bank's funds:

 * Business email compromise
 * Compromised user database
 * Financial records leak
 * Theft
 * Supply chain attack

Consider these potential risks in relation to the bank's operating environment. Then, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) in the Notes area of the template describing how security events are possible considering the risks facing the funds in this operating environment.

* **Step 4: Scores risks based on their likelihood**

As you might recall, risk can be calculated with this simple formula:

**Likelihood x Impact = Risk**

In order to calculate the score for a security risk, you must first estimate and score the likelihood of the risk causing a security event. The likelihood of a risk can be based on available evidence, prior experience, or expert judgment. A common way to estimate the likelihood of the risk is to determine the potential frequency of the risk occurring:

* Could the risk happen once a day?
* Could the risk happen once a month?
* Could the risk happen once in a year?

For example, the bank must have enough funds available each day to meet its legal requirements. A potential risk that could prevent the bank from replenishing its funds is a supply chain disruption. Being located in a coastal area, there's a likelihood that the bank may experience supply chain disruptions caused by hurricanes. However, a hurricane might only impact the bank every few years, so you can score the likelihood as low.

In this instance, the team is scoring the likelihood of an event on a scale of 1-3:

* 1 represents an event with a low chance of occuring.
* 2 represents an event with a moderate chance of occuring.
* 3 represents a high chance of occuring.

Review the Risk(s), Description, and Notes of the risk register template. Refer to the risk matrix and use it to estimate a likelihood score for each risk. Then, enter a score (1-3) for each risk in the Likelihood column of the register.

* **Step 5: Scores risks based on their severity**
  
A severity score is an estimate of the overall impact that might occur as a result of an event. For example, damage can occur to a company's reputation or finances and there may be a loss of data, customers, or assets. Evaluating the severity of a risk helps businesses determine the level of risk they can tolerate and how assets might be affected. 

When evaluating the severity of a risk, consider the potential consequences of that risk occurring:

* How would the business be affected?
* What's the financial harm to the business and its customers?
* Can important operations or services be impacted?
* Are there regulations that can be violated?
* What is the reputational damage to the company's standing?

Use the top row of the risk matrix and consider the potential impact of each risk. Estimate a severity score for each risk. Then, enter a score (1-3) for each risk in the Severity column of the register:

* 1 (low severity)
* 2 (moderate severity)
* 3 (high severity)

For example, a leak of financial records might lead to a loss of profits, a loss of customers, and heavy regulatory fines. A risk such as this might receive a severity score of 3 because it greatly impacts the bank's ability to operate.

* **Step 6: Calculate on overall risk score**

Ultimately, the goal of performing a risk assessment is to help security teams prioritize their efforts and resources.

Using the risk formula, multiply the likelihood and severity score for each risk. Then, enter a priority score (1-9) for each of the risks in the Priority column of the register.

# Activity #2: Classify the assets connected to a home network

**Activity Overview**

In this activity, you will classify assets connected to a home office network.

Asset management is a critical part of every organization's security plan. Remember that asset management is the process of tracking assets and the risks that affect them. Effective asset management starts with creating an asset inventory, or a catalog of assets that need to be protected. Then, it involves classifying assets based on their level of importance and sensitivity to risk.

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work. 

**Scenario**

Review the following scenario. Then, complete the step-by-step instructions.

One of the most valuable assets in the world today is information. Most information is accessed over a network. There tend to be a variety of devices connected to a network and each is a potential entry point to other assets.

An inventory of network devices can be a useful asset management tool. An inventory can highlight sensitive assets that require extra protection.

![ATV](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac519a34-0677-4a45-80a6-60e0842b94ec)

Youâ€™re operating a small business from your home and must create an inventory of your network devices. This will help you determine which ones contain sensitive information that require extra protection.

To do this, you will start by identifying three devices that have access to your home network. This might include devices such as:

* Desktop or laptop computers
* Smartphones
* Smart home devices
* Game consoles
* Storage devices or servers
* Video streaming devices

Then, youâ€™ll list important characteristics of each device such as its owner, location, and type. Finally, you will assign each device a level of sensitivity based on how important it is to protect.

**Step-By-Step Instructions**

Follow the instructions and answer the end-of-activity question to complete the activity. Then, go to the next course item to compare your work to a completed exemplar.

**Step 1: Access the template**

To use the template for this course item, click the link below and select Use Template. 

**Link to template:** [Portfolio (Part-2) Home asset inventory.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17930590/Portfolio.Part-2.Home.asset.inventory.xlsx)

**Step 2: Identify assets**

In the asset inventory spreadsheet, find the **Asset** column header. Consider the devices that may be connected to the home network. Examine devices in the scenario graphic to help you brainstorm.

Choose three devices that are not already listed in the spreadsheet and add them to the empty rows in the **Asset** column.

**Step 3: Fill in the characteristics of each asset**

List important characteristics, including **Network access, Owner, and Location** for each asset that youâ€™ve identified.

Hereâ€™s an explanation of each characteristic: 

* Network access describes how often the device is connected to the network.
* Owner describes the person responsible for the device.
* Location describes where the device is located in relation to the router.

**Step 4: Evaluate the access of network devices** 

Review the information that youâ€™ve listed in the **Network access, Owner, and Location** columns.

In the **Notes** column, record 1 or 2 details or characteristics of each device. Do this by asking yourself questions about each:

* What kind of information is stored on the device?
* How does it connect to the network?
* Is the owner careful about securing it?

For example, the desktop computer contains sensitive information, like photos, that only the owner should have access to. In contrast, the network router uses one frequency for smart home devices and another for all other devices.

**Step 5: Classify the sensitivity of network devices**

Itâ€™s time to classify assets based on the information youâ€™ve collected. Do this by thinking about how an asset could impact your business if its security was compromised:

* What types of information would be disclosed or stolen?
* Could an attacker alter information on the device?
* What would happen to the business if this information were destroyed?

For example, the network router is classified as confidential because the owner has granted limited access to the device to specific users.

Find the **Sensitivity** column in the asset inventory. Type one of the four levels of sensitivity you previously learned about.

Here is a completed Activity along with an explanation of how the exemplar fulfills the expectations.

# Activity #3: Determine appropriate data handling practices

**Activity Overview**

In this activity, you will review the results of a data risk assessment. You will determine whether effective data handling processes are being implemented to protect information privacy.

Data is among the most valuable assets in the world today. Everything from intellectual property to guest WiFi networks should be protected with a combination of technical, operational, and managerial controls. Implementing the principle of least privilege is essential to protect information privacy.

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work.

**Scenario**

Review the following scenario. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

You work for an educational technology company that developed an application to help teachers automatically grade assignments. The application handles a wide range of data that it collects from academic institutions, instructors, parents, and students.

Your team was alerted to a data leak of internal business plans on social media. An investigation by the team discovered that an employee accidentally shared those confidential documents with a customer. An audit into the leak is underway to determine how similar incidents can be avoided.

A supervisor provided you with information regarding the leak. It appears that the principle of least privilege was not observed by employees at the company during a sales meeting. You have been asked to analyze the situation and find ways to prevent it from happening again.

First, you'll need to evaluate details about the incident. Then, you'll review the controls in place to prevent data leaks. Next, you'll identify ways to improve information privacy at the company. Finally, you'll justify why you think your recommendations will make data handling at the company more secure.

**Step-By-Step Instructions**

**Step 1: Access the template**
To use the template for this course item, click the link and select Use Template

**Link to template:** [Portfolio (Part-3) Activity Template Data.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17930665/Portfolio.Part-3.Activity.Template.Data.pdf)

**Step 2: Analyze the situation**

The principle of least privilege is a fundamental security control that helps maintain information privacy. However, least privilege starts to lose its effectiveness when too many users are given access to information. Data leaks commonly happen as information gets passed between people without oversight.

To start your analysis, review the following incident summary provided by your supervisor:

A customer success representative received access to a folder of internal documents from a manager. It contained files associated with a new product offering, including customer analytics and marketing materials. The manager forgot to unshare the folder. Later, the representative copied a link to the marketing materials to share with a customer during a sales call. Instead, the representative shared a link to the entire folder. During the sales call, the customer received the link to internal documents and posted it to their social media page.

After reviewing the summary, write **20-60 words (2-3 sentences)** in the **Issue(s)** row of the Data leak worksheet describing the factors that led to the data leak.  

**Step 3: Review current data privacy controls**

Data leaks are a major risk due to the amount of data handled by the application. The company used the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) to develop their plan for addressing their information privacy concerns.

Review the **Security plan snapshot** resource of the worksheet. Then, review the **NIST SP 800-53: AC-6** resource of the worksheet.

After, write **20-60 words (2-3 sentences)** in the **Review** row of the Data leak worksheet to summarize what you've learned about NIST SP 800-53: AC-6.

**Step 4: Identify control enhancement**

The company's implementation of least privilege is based on NIST Special Publication 800-53 (SP 800-53). NIST developed SP 800-53 to provide businesses with a customizable information privacy plan. It's a comprehensive resource that describes a wide range of control categories, including least privilege.

Use the **NIST SP 800-53: AC-6** resource to determine two control enhancements that might have prevented the data leak. List the **two improvements** in the **Recommendation(s)** row of the worksheet.

**Step 5: Justify your recommendations**

At the end of your analysis, it's time to communicate your findings to your supervisor. It's important to justify your recommendations so that the supervisor can relay this information to other decision makers at the company.

Consider the issues you identified earlier. Then, write 20-60 words (2-3 sentences) in the Justification row describing why you think the control enhancements you recommend will reduce the likelihood of another data leak.

# Activity #3: Improve authentication, authorization, and accounting for a small business

**Activity Overview**

In this activity, you will assess the access controls used by a business. Youâ€™ll analyze their current process, identify issues, and make recommendations to improve their security practices.

Previously, you learned that access controls are security controls that manage access, authorization, and accountability of information. Authentication controls are used to verify who someone is, whereas authorization controls are used to grant a user permissions and set limits on the things theyâ€™re allowed to do. When done well, access controls are the key to decreasing the likelihood of a security risk.

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work.

**Scenario**

Review the scenario below. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

Youâ€™re the first cybersecurity professional hired by a growing business.

Recently, a deposit was made from the business to an unknown bank account. The finance manager says they didnâ€™t make a mistake. Fortunately, they were able to stop the payment. The owner has asked you to investigate what happened to prevent any future incidents.

To do this, youâ€™ll need to do some accounting on the incident to better understand what happened. First, you will review the access log of the incident. Next, you will take notes that can help you identify a possible threat actor. Then, you will spot issues with the access controls that were exploited by the user. Finally, you will recommend mitigations that can improve the business' access controls and reduce the likelihood that this incident reoccurs.

**Step 3: Review the event log of this payroll incident**

Event logs contain information related to the operation and usage of a system. They can be utilized to identify suspicious activity, detect vulnerabilities, and track users.

Find the **Event log** tab of the Accounting exercise spreadsheet. Carefully review the event log of this incident to start your investigation. Notice the Event Type, Date, Time, and IP Address of the user in the log details.

Make **1-2 notes** of information that you learned about the user from reviewing the Event log details. Add your **notes** to the Notes column of the access control worksheet.

**Step 4: Identify access control issues that led to the incident**

Log details tell you a lot about a specific moment in time. You can find other useful details about an event by cross referencing that information with other sources.

This business has a range of different employees. They all currently manage company resources using a shared cloud drive.

Find the **Employee directory** tab of the Accounting exercise spreadsheet. Compare the information found in the Employee directory tab with the information in the Event log tab. Notice any similarities between the details in the Event log and the details in the Employee directory.

Then, list **1-2** issues that you discover with how the business handles employee access in the **Issues** column of the Access control worksheet.

**Step 5: Recommend mitigations that can prevent a future breach**

Youâ€™ve completed your accounting of the strange payment and discovered flaws with how the business handles their information.

Find the **Recommendation(s)** column of the Access control worksheet. Make **at least 2** recommendations of mitigations the business can implement to prevent incidents like this in the future.

For example, one recommendation might be to have procedures in place to revoke access to files when an employee is no longer with the company.

# Portfolio Activity #1: Analyze a vulnerable system for a small business

**Activity Overview**

In this activity, you will conduct a vulnerability assessment for a small business. You will  evaluate the risks of a vulnerable information system and outline a remediation plan

A vulnerability assessment is the internal review process of an organizationâ€™s security systems. As a cybersecurity analyst, you might help with vulnerability assessments to prevent attacks in an organization. Later, you can add this document to your cybersecurity portfolio, which you can share with prospective employers or recruiters. To review the importance of building a professional portfolio and options for creating your portfolio, read Create a cybersecurity portfolio

**Scenario**

Review the following scenario. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

You are a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company. The company stores information on a remote database server, since many of the employees work remotely from locations all around the world. Employees of the company regularly query, or request, data from the server to find potential customers. The database has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago. As a cybersecurity professional, you recognize that keeping the database server open to the public is a serious vulnerability.

A vulnerability assessment of the situation can help you communicate the potential risks with decision makers at the company. You must create a written report that clearly explains how the vulnerable server is a risk to business operations and how it can be secured.
