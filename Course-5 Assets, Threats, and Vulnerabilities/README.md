#  Assets, Threats, and Vulnerabilities

I have completed extensive training on **Asset protection** and **cybersecurity Risk management**, focusing on how organizations determine which assets to protect. This training involved exploring the relationship between **risk management** and **asset classification**, addressing the unique challenges involved in securing both **physical** and **digital assets**. I gained a strong understanding of the **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)** framework, including its standards, guidelines, and best practices for managing cybersecurity risks.

I also developed expertise in **security controls** that safeguard organizational assets, with a particular focus on how **privacy** impacts asset security. I studied the critical role of **encryption** in protecting the privacy of digital assets and the importance of **authentication** and **authorization systems** in verifying users' identities.

Additionally, I acquired a deep understanding of the vulnerability management process, examining common vulnerabilities and adopting an **attacker mindset** to understand how these vulnerabilities can become threats to asset security if exploited. I explored common types of digital asset threats and the tools and techniques used by cybercriminals to target assets. Furthermore, I was introduced to the threat modeling process, learning how security professionals anticipate and mitigate potential security breaches to proactively protect assets.

# Activity #1: Score risks based on their likelihood and severity

* **Activity Overview**

In this activity, you will practice performing a risk assessment by evaluating vulnerabilities that commonly threaten business operations. Then, you will decide how to prioritize your resources based on the risk scores you assign each vulnerability.

You might recall that the purpose of having a security plan is to be prepared for risks. Assessing potential risks is one of the first steps of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), a voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk. Risk assessments are how security teams determine whether their security operations are adequately positioned to prevent cyber attacks and protect sensitive information.

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work.

* **Scenario**

Review the following scenario. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

You've joined a new cybersecurity team at a commercial bank. The team is conducting a risk assessment of the bank's current operational environment. As part of the assessment, they are creating a risk register to help them focus on securing the most vulnerable risks.

A risk register is a central record of potential risks to an organization's assets, information systems, and data. Security teams commonly use risk registers when conducting a risk assessment.

Your supervisor asks you to evaluate a set of risks that the cybersecurity team has recorded in the risk register. For each risk, you will first determine how likely that risk is to occur. Then, you will determine how severely that risk may impact the bank. Finally, you will calculate a score for the severity of that risk. You will then compare scores across all risks so your team can determine how to prioritize their attention for each risk.

# Activity #2: Classify the assets connected to a home network

* **Activity Overview**

In this activity, you will classify assets connected to a home office network.

Asset management is a critical part of every organization's security plan. Remember that asset management is the process of tracking assets and the risks that affect them. Effective asset management starts with creating an asset inventory, or a catalog of assets that need to be protected. Then, it involves classifying assets based on their level of importance and sensitivity to risk.

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work. 

* **Scenario**

Review the following scenario. Then, complete the step-by-step instructions.

One of the most valuable assets in the world today is information. Most information is accessed over a network. There tend to be a variety of devices connected to a network and each is a potential entry point to other assets.

An inventory of network devices can be a useful asset management tool. An inventory can highlight sensitive assets that require extra protection.

# Activity #3: Improve authentication, authorization, and accounting for a small business

**Activity Overview**

In this activity, you will assess the access controls used by a business. You’ll analyze their current process, identify issues, and make recommendations to improve their security practices.

Previously, you learned that access controls are security controls that manage access, authorization, and accountability of information. Authentication controls are used to verify who someone is, whereas authorization controls are used to grant a user permissions and set limits on the things they’re allowed to do. When done well, access controls are the key to decreasing the likelihood of a security risk.

# Activity #4: Identify the attack vectors of a USB drive

**Activity Overview**

In this activity, you will assess the attack vectors of a USB drive. You will consider a scenario of finding a USB drive in a parking lot from both the perspective of an attacker and a target.

USBs, or flash drives, are commonly used for storing and transporting data. However, some characteristics of these small, convenient devices can also introduce security risks. Threat actors frequently use USBs to deliver malicious software, damage other hardware, or even take control of devices. USB baiting is an attack in which a threat actor strategically leaves a malware USB stick for an employee to find and install to unknowingly infect a network. It relies on curious people to plug in an unfamiliar flash drive that they find.

**Scenario**

Review the following scenario. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

You are part of the security team at Rhetorical Hospital and arrive to work one morning. On the ground of the parking lot, you find a USB stick with the hospital's logo printed on it. There’s no one else around who might have dropped it, so you decide to pick it up out of curiosity.

You bring the USB drive back to your office where the team has virtualization software installed on a workstation. Virtualization software can be used for this very purpose because it’s one of the only ways to safely investigate an unfamiliar USB stick. The  software works by running a simulated instance of the computer on the same workstation. This simulation isn’t connected to other files or networks, so the USB drive can’t affect other systems if it happens to be infected with malicious software.

# Activity #5: Apply the PASTA threat model framework

**Activity Overview**

In this activity, you will practice using the Process of Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis (PASTA) threat model framework. You will determine whether a new shopping app is safe to launch.

Threat modeling is an important part of secure software development. Security teams typically perform threat models to identify vulnerabilities before malicious actors do. PASTA is a commonly used framework for assessing the risk profile of new applications.

**Scenario**    

Review the following scenario. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

You’re part of the growing security team at a company for sneaker enthusiasts and collectors. The business is preparing to launch a mobile app that makes it easy for their customers to buy and sell shoes. 

You are performing a threat model of the application using the PASTA framework. You will go through each of the seven stages of the framework to identify security requirements for the new sneaker company app.
