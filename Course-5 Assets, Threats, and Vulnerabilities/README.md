#  Assets, Threats, and Vulnerabilities

I have completed extensive training on **Asset protection** and **cybersecurity Risk management**, focusing on how organizations determine which assets to protect. This training involved exploring the relationship between **risk management** and **asset classification**, addressing the unique challenges involved in securing both **physical** and **digital assets**. I gained a strong understanding of the **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)** framework, including its standards, guidelines, and best practices for managing cybersecurity risks.

I also developed expertise in **security controls** that safeguard organizational assets, with a particular focus on how **privacy** impacts asset security. I studied the critical role of **encryption** in protecting the privacy of digital assets and the importance of **authentication** and **authorization systems** in verifying users' identities.

Additionally, I acquired a deep understanding of the vulnerability management process, examining common vulnerabilities and adopting an **attacker mindset** to understand how these vulnerabilities can become threats to asset security if exploited. I explored common types of digital asset threats and the tools and techniques used by cybercriminals to target assets. Furthermore, I was introduced to the threat modeling process, learning how security professionals anticipate and mitigate potential security breaches to proactively protect assets.
