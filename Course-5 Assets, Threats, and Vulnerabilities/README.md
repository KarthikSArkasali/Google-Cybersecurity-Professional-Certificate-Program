#  Assets, Threats, and Vulnerabilities

I have completed extensive training on **Asset protection** and **cybersecurity Risk management**, focusing on how organizations determine which assets to protect. This training involved exploring the relationship between **risk management** and **asset classification**, addressing the unique challenges involved in securing both **physical** and **digital assets**. I gained a strong understanding of the **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)** framework, including its standards, guidelines, and best practices for managing cybersecurity risks.

I also developed expertise in **security controls** that safeguard organizational assets, with a particular focus on how **privacy** impacts asset security. I studied the critical role of **encryption** in protecting the privacy of digital assets and the importance of **authentication** and **authorization systems** in verifying users' identities.

Additionally, I acquired a deep understanding of the vulnerability management process, examining common vulnerabilities and adopting an **attacker mindset** to understand how these vulnerabilities can become threats to asset security if exploited. I explored common types of digital asset threats and the tools and techniques used by cybercriminals to target assets. Furthermore, I was introduced to the threat modeling process, learning how security professionals anticipate and mitigate potential security breaches to proactively protect assets.

# Portfolio Activity #1: Score risks based on their likelihood and severity

**Activity Overview**

In this activity, you will practice performing a risk assessment by evaluating vulnerabilities that commonly threaten business operations. Then, you will decide how to prioritize your resources based on the risk scores you assign each vulnerability.

You might recall that the purpose of having a security plan is to be prepared for risks. Assessing potential risks is one of the first steps of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), a voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk. Risk assessments are how security teams determine whether their security operations are adequately positioned to prevent cyber attacks and protect sensitive information.

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work.

**Scenario**

Review the following scenario. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

You've joined a new cybersecurity team at a commercial bank. The team is conducting a risk assessment of the bank's current operational environment. As part of the assessment, they are creating a risk register to help them focus on securing the most vulnerable risks.

A risk register is a central record of potential risks to an organization's assets, information systems, and data. Security teams commonly use risk registers when conducting a risk assessment.

Your supervisor asks you to evaluate a set of risks that the cybersecurity team has recorded in the risk register. For each risk, you will first determine how likely that risk is to occur. Then, you will determine how severely that risk may impact the bank. Finally, you will calculate a score for the severity of that risk. You will then compare scores across all risks so your team can determine how to prioritize their attention for each risk.
